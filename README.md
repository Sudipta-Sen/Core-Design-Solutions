# Core-Design-Solutions

## Overview
Welcome to **Core-Design-Solutions!** This repository contains a collection of low-level system design problems and their corresponding solutions. Each problem addresses common challenges in areas such as multithreading, caching, file I/O, and task scheduling, designed to help you build robust, scalable, and efficient systems.

The repository is intended for system design practice, with problems solved using various design patterns and principles. It is also a great resource for interview preparation, especially for positions that focus on low-level design.

## Problem List
Each problem is contained in its own folder, along with a detailed README explaining the problem, the approach taken, and the instructions to run the solution. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including concurrency, synchronization, and more.
